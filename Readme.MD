# Advent of Code 2023

Today it is 1 December. The first day of the 2023 Advent. 
I will be trying to solve the puzzles this year, hopefully in a timely fashion, 
but first and foremost as practice.
I will try to solve the puzzles with JavaScrit again and if time permits, 
I might also give it a try with Python as I will be looking at Python more 
in the upcoming months.

## --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

At first glance, this first day seems pretty straightforward and it turned out to be quite doable in part 1.
Part 2 of the first day was a lot more challenging, but I ended up solving it by handling the input strings, 
writing them back to a file and use that file as input for my code that solved part 1.


## --- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
